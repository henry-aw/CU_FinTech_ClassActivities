# Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_name` is equal to "Mr. Farley". If so, print a string of "Hello Mr. Farley" using the `c1_name` variable. If not, print a string of "Hello stranger".


# Write an if-else statement to check if `c2_age` is greater than `c1_age`. If so, print a string of "Mr. Farley is older than Mr. Snuggles". Else if `c1_age` is greater than `c2_age`, print a string of "Mr. Snuggles is older than Mr. Farley". Else, `c1_age` must have to be equal to `c2_age`, therefore print a string of "Mr. Farley is the same age as Mr. Snuggles".


# Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_profession` is equal to "Web Developer" AND `c2_profession` is equal to "Accountant". If so, print a string of "Look a Web Developer and an Accountant", else print a string of "They are professionals."


# Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_location` is equal to "Oakland, CA". If so, print a string of "Mr. Farley comes from the home of the Raiders!". Else if `c1_location` is equal to a string of "San Francisco, CA", print a string of "Mr. Farley comes from the home of the 49ers!". Else both conditions must not apply and therefore print a string "Mr. Farley doesn't hail from a sports town."
