# Variables

# This is a comment - any code commented out is not run -
# meaning that any code or text commented out is ignored.

"""
this is a multi-line comment
You can comment out many lines at once.
For the most part you will see single line comments
but it is good to see this.
As in single line comments, any code contained within multi-line comments are not run -
meaning that any code commented out is ignored.
