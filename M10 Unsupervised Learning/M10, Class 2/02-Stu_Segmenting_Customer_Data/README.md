# Segmenting Customer Data

In this activity, you will use the elbow method and the K-means model to segment a dataset into the optimal number of clusters.

## Instructions

One of the world's biggest banks launched a machine learning competition in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. They want to improve their marketing campaigns by identifying the optimal number of customer segments for their clients. They offer a reward of $5,000 that gained your interest, so you decided to put your unsupervised learning skills into practice to participate in the competition.

The bank provided a dataset that consists of customer data that includes ten different features. The data columns were anonymized using generic names to protect customers' privacy, and data values were already normalized.

Use the starter code to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Load the raw data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

3. Segment the data with K-means.
