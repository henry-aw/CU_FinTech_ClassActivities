# Pros and Cons of Deploying Machine Learning Models in the Cloud

As a FinTech professional, it's important for you to identify the pros and cons of using cloud services to deploy machine learning models. In this activity, you will conduct a research to find evidences that may support your group's posture. Those groups whose group number is odd are in favor of using the cloud, and groups whose group number is even are against it.

## Instructions

1. Use the first ten minutes of this activity to search on the internet for technical blog posts, white papers, industry use cases, or research papers that can give you arguments to support your group's posture. Set a timer to have time for final conclusions.

2. You can use [the general Google engine](https://www.google.com/) to search for supporting evidence on the web, or you can use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to search for research papers, books, or technical notes.

3. As a starting point, you can read the following articles:

    * [Clever clouds: Considerations when outsourcing AI](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/key-cloud-considerations)

    * [The Benefits of Cloud Native ML And AI](https://medium.com/@ODSC/the-benefits-of-cloud-native-ml-and-ai-b88f6d71783)

    * [Cloud Native Machine Learning And AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/07/05/cloud-native-machine-learning-and-ai/)

4. In the final minutes of the activity, write down your groups conclusions. It may be handy to have one of the group members share their screen and share a Google Doc where everyone can write.

5. Get ready to present your conclusions to the class.
