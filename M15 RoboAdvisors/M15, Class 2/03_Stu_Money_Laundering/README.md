# Credit Risk Classification with Amazon SageMaker

In this activity, you will gain hands-on experience in deploying a machine learning model into the cloud to predict whether or not a cash or transfer bank transaction is potential money laundering fraud. You'll use the SageMaker built-in Linear Learner algorithm.

## Background

Money laundering is a major problem that financial institutions face worldwide. The scale of money laundering is difficult to assess, but it is considered to be significant. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered each year. That’s between $850 billion and $2.22 trillion dollars each year.

Machine learning offers a powerful solution to identify anomalous activity on bank transactions that can lead to a money-laundering criminal operation.

In this activity, you will use computer-generated data based on real-world bank transactions to deploy a model using Amazon SageMaker Studio to help fight this crime.

## Instructions

* You will work in groups of 2 or 3 people. You should choose one person of the group to share their screen as the group walks through each cell of code one by one while inspecting and commenting about the code you are going to execute.

* Open your Amazon SageMaker Studio, and upload the provided `predicting_money_laundering.ipynb` notebook.

* Walk through the cell steps and add any missing code.

* The notebook will guide you through the process to create, train and deploy a supervised *classification* model using the Amazon SageMaker's built-in Linear Learner algorithm.

* Take a look at the [Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner Algorithm documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html) if you have any questions about how it works.
