# Storytelling with a Chloropleth Plot

The focus of this activity is creating a choropleth plot to visualize the data from the 2011 Annual State Agricultural Exports dataset.

## Instructions

1. Open the [starter file](Unsolved/mapping_agriculture_exports.ipynb), and prep your Mapbox API Credentials.

2. Create a Pandas DataFrame from the "2011_us_ag_exports.csv" file that is located in the Resources folder.

3. Plot the data as a chloropleth using `total exports` for the column values.

4. Plot the data as a chloropleth using `corn` for the column values.


### Hint

For more detailed information on building chloropleth plots with Plotly and the Mapbox API, check out the documentation [here](https://plotly.com/python/mapbox-county-choropleth/).
