    "In this activity, you will build familiarity working with a Jupyter notebook inside the JupyterLab environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the desktop of your machine, create a folder called \"JupyterLab_Practice\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open your terminal (Terminal for Mac users, Gitbash for Windows users) and navigate to the JupyterLab_Practice folder.'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate your Conda `dev` environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With the `dev` environment active, launch JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open the visible \"Launcher\" tab  as a Python 3 notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Right-clicking on the tab, select `Rename Notebook...` and name the notebook \"notebook_practice.ipynb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Perform each of the following actions within the notebook_practice.ipynb notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Add a new cell that contains two variables. Assign the variables numeric values.\n",
    "    * Add a new cell and assign it as a \"Markdown\" cell. Include a header and some text.\n",
    "    * Add a new cell that includes both a comment and a variable that adds together the two numeric variables you created earlier. Write the code to print the value of this variable.\n",
    "    * Navigate back to the first cell and run each cell individually using the single-play arrow icon.\n",
    "    * Add a new cell that includes a variable that multiplies together the two numeric variables you created earlier. Write the code to print the value of this variable using the print function and an f-string.\n",
    "    * Using the double-play arrow icon, restart and run the notebook from the beginning.\n",
    "    * Cut the Markdown cell that was created above."
