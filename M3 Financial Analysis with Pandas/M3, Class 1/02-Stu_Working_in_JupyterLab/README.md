# Working in JupyterLab

In this activity, you will build familiarity working with a Jupyter notebook inside the JupyterLab environment.


## Instructions

1. Create a folder called `JupyterLab_Practice` on your computer's desktop.

2. Open your terminal (Terminal for Mac users and Git Bash for Windows users) and navigate to the `JupyterLab_Practice` folder.

3. Activate your Conda `dev` environment.

4. With the `dev` environment active, launch JupyterLab.

5. Open the visible Launcher tab  as a Python 3 notebook.

6. Right-click on the tab and select "Rename Notebook..." Name the notebook `notebook_practice.ipynb`.

7. In `notebook_practice.ipynb`, complete the following actions:

    * Add a new cell that contains two variables. Assign the variables numeric values.
    
    * Add a new cell and assign it as a Markdown cell. Include a header and some text.
    
    * Add a new cell that includes both a comment and a variable and that adds together the two numeric variables you created earlier. Write the code to print the value of this variable.
    
    * Navigate back to the first cell and run each cell individually using the single-play arrow icon.
    
    * Add a new cell that includes a variable and that multiplies the two numeric variables you created earlier. Write the code to print the value of this variable,  using the `print` function and an f-string.
    
    * Using the double-play arrow icon, restart and run the notebook from the beginning.
    
    * Cut the Markdown cell that was created above.
