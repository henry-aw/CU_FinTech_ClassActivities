    "# Ethereum Tester\n",
    "In this activity you will utilize the Web3.py library as well as the `ethereum-tester` library and its `EthereumTesterProvider` to interact with a mock Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the Web3.py library, import `Web3` and the `EthereumTesterProvider`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the `EthereumTesterProvider` equal to a variable called `provider`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an instance of `Web3` passing the `provider` as a parameter. Set this equal to a variable called `w3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the web3.eth API's `get_block` function to access the \"latest\" block in your mock blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use the web3.eth API's `accounts` function to access a list of account addresses that can be used to create a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use the web3.eth API's `get_balance` function to determine the wei balance in one of the accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use Web3.py's `fromWei` function to calculate the number of ether in the account specified in step 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create and assign the following 4 variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `sender` - assign it a value of one of the addresses from step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `receiver` - assign it a different address from step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `gas` - assign it a minium of 21000 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `value` - the value should be the number of ether you want to send, but you will need to use the `toWei` function to convert it to the required wei.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Use the web3.eth API's `send_transaction` function to send a transaction to the mock Ethereum blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Use the web3.eth API's `get_transaction` function to find the details of the transaction, also known as the transaction object, sent in step 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Hint:  You will need to use the transaction hash returned from the transaction to complete this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Use the web3.eth API's `get_block` function to access the \"latest\" block in your mock blockchain. Has the block information changed from what was returned in step 4?\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Use the web3.eth API's `replace_transaction` function to update the units of `gas` in the original transaction. **NOTE:** This step will result in an ERROR - why do you think this occurs?"
