# KNN Bank Marketing Campaigns

In this activity you will use the provided dataset of a bank's telemarketing campaign. The bank's marketing partner ran the campaign and the bank has labeled the customers that opened an account after receiving a phone call. Now they want you to build a model that will help them to identify customers so they can provide the marketer with a better list of potential customers in the future.

**Hint**: The column `y` is the target column.

## Instructions:

1. Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Separate the features `X` from the target `y`.

3. Encode the categorical variables from the features data using [`get_dummies`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html).

4. Separate the data into training and testing subsets.

5. Scale the data using [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)

6. Instantiate an K Nearest Neighbor Classifier instance.

7. Fit the model using the training data.

8. Make predictions using the testing data.

9. Generate the classification report for the test data.
