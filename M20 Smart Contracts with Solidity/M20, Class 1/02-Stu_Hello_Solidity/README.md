# Hello Solidity!

In this activity, you will create simple smart contact using Solidity to corroborate that you can open the Remix IDE and successfully compile a contract.

## Instructions

1. Open the Remix IDE and create a new Solidity script named `HelloSolidity.sol`.

2. Add the pragma statement to use Solidity version 5.

3. Create a new contract called `HelloSolidity`.

4. Add two `address` type variables. One is called `sender`, and the other is called `receiver`.

5. Assign the following Ethereum address to the `sender` variable: `0xc3879B456DAA348a16B6524CBC558d2CC984722c`.

6. Add a `string` type variable named `message` and assign the text `Hello Solidity!` to it.

7. Compile the contract and fix any bugs if they arise.
