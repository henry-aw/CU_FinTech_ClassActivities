# Time-series Warmup

To start off, let's stretch our time series legs and use some of the code we learned in the previous class. In particular, we'll use what we've learned to visualize hourly patterns in the price and volume of Bitcoin.

## Instructions

Using the starter file, complete the following steps. (Steps 1 and 2 are completed already in the starter code).

1. Import libraries and dependencies.

2. Read in the `bitcoin_hourly` CSV file, and prepare the data.

3. Plot volume in a line plot using `hvplot` to get a sense of what's typical volume for the cryptocurrency.

4. Use Pandas `groupby` and the `weekofyear` function on the `datetime` index to create a `hvplot` bar plot of the data. (Hint: use  `kind='bar'` as a parameter in the hvPlot function).

5. Similarly, group by the `datetime` index hour and plot average prices and volume by hour, for each of the 24 hours in a day.

6. Let's then take a lightheared look at cryptosentiment, by looking at whether a couple of tweets by Elon Musk regarding Bitcoin have moved the market.

    * Using datetime indexing, slice the volume and price DataFrame to one day before and after Jan 29, 2021, when Elon Musk added the hashtag #bitcoin to his Twitter bio.

    * Did Musk's posts appear to move the market for the cryptocurrency? If so, did it move prices, or just volume?
