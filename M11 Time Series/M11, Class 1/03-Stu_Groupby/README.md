# DateTime Groupby

In this exercise you will get the opportunity to practice grouping by DateTime indices and analyzing the results.

## Instructions

Using the [starter code](Unsolved/spy-groupby.ipynb), Perform the following:

1. Import the data, taking care to declare the `datetime` index.

2. Slice the data to one specific month--say, last December, March, or January.

3. Save the total volume of shares traded for that month into a new variable.

4. Group the bigger dataset on share volume into `year` and `month` using the `datetime` index. Use this grouping to create a DataFrame of total monthly SPY shares traded each month.

5. Using the DataFrame constructed in step (4), Calculate the `median` monthly total volume of shares traded in the S&P 500.

6. Compare this `median` number to the number you calculated in step (3). How does that month compare in terms of trading activity?
